# Frontend-Backend Integration Verification

This document provides a checklist for manually verifying that your Netlify frontend is correctly integrated with your Render backend.

## Automated Testing

For automated testing of the integration, you can use one of these methods:

### Option 1: Simple API Test (Recommended)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install node-fetch

# Run the simple API test
node manual-api-test.js
```

### Option 2: Comprehensive Integration Test

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install axios colors

# Run the integration test
node test-frontend-backend-integration.js
```

### Option 3: Quick API Status Check

```bash
# Run the API status check
node check-api-status.js
```

## Manual Verification Checklist

### 1. Public Endpoints

- [ ] **Homepage Loads**: Visit your Netlify site and verify the homepage loads correctly

  - Click on an order to view details
  - Verify all order information is displayed correctly

### 4. Real-time Features (if applicable)

- [ ] **Order Status Updates**: Check if order status updates are reflected in real-time
- [ ] **Notifications**: Verify if notifications are received for order updates

### 5. Error Handling

- [ ] **Form Validation**: Test form validation on all forms
  - Try submitting forms with invalid data
  - Verify appropriate error messages are displayed

- [ ] **API Error Handling**: Test how the frontend handles API errors
  - Try actions that might cause errors (e.g., adding invalid items to cart)
  - Verify user-friendly error messages are displayed

### 6. Performance

- [ ] **Loading States**: Check if loading indicators are shown during API calls
- [ ] **Response Time**: Verify that the application feels responsive
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test the application on mobile devices or using browser dev tools

## Troubleshooting Common Integration Issues

### CORS Issues
If you see errors in the browser console related to CORS:
1. Verify that your Render backend has CORS configured correctly
2. Check that the allowed origins include your Netlify domain

### Authentication Issues
If login/registration doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify that the frontend is sending requests to the correct API endpoints
3. Check that the JWT token is being stored and sent correctly

### Data Not Loading
If data isn't displaying:
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify API endpoints using a tool like Postman
3. Check that the frontend is correctly parsing and displaying the API response

## Next Steps After Verification

Once you've verified the integration:
1. **Document any issues** found during testing
2. **Fix critical issues** before proceeding to production
3. **Consider user acceptance testing** with real users
4. **Set up monitoring** for both frontend and backend
5. **Create a backup and recovery plan** for your database
